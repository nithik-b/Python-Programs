The morning sun filtered through the trees, casting long, dappled shadows across the forest floor.
Birds chirped in the distance, their songs echoing through the cool air, while a gentle breeze rustled the leaves.
The scent of damp earth and pine filled the atmosphere, making everything feel fresh and alive.
In the clearing ahead, a small brook bubbled over smooth stones, its crystal-clear water sparkling in the sunlight.
Everything seemed still and peaceful, as if the world itself was taking a deep breath, ready to begin the day anew.
